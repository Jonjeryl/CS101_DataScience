```{r}

```
# D Is there a relationship between shoe size and height? Why?
# No, because the shoe size does not affect the height

# 3
```{r}
summary(months_vector)

```
# Interpret the results of both vectors. Are they both equally useful in this case?
# Yes, because they show the lenght, data type and contents of both vectors.
